# Fraud-Detection
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Checked for missing values (none found) and duplicates (none found).
Visualized the amount feature with a histogram, observing most values are low.
Used bar charts for categorical features, e.g., most common source_prefix and dest_prefix values are "Whiskers"; most frequent agent is "A".
Scatter plots showed most fraud (label=1) transactions occur with low amounts.

Supervised Learning: Random Forest

Feature Engineering: Dropped features like amount, label, and others to improve model performance.
Handled class imbalance (fraud vs. non-fraud) using SMOTE for oversampling.
Skipped feature scaling as Random Forest doesnâ€™t require it.
Evaluated model with confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, and recall.
Performed backward selection to identify important features.
Best model excluded ['label','source_postfix','source_prefix','agent','amount'].

Unsupervised Learning: KMeans and GMM with PCA

Used PCA for dimensionality reduction, selecting 2 components via elbow plot for better clustering.
Determined 3 optimal clusters via elbow plot; evaluated with silhouette scores.
Best clustering achieved using only amount and status features.
PCA improved clustering performance and visualization by reducing dimensions and removing feature correlation.
